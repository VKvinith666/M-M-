​VK — Mood & Daily Motivation is a standalone web application designed to help users pause, acknowledge their emotional state, and receive encouraging, context-specific quotes. It combines a clean, dark-themed UI with a focus on self-care and mental discipline.
​✨ Key Features
​Mood Selection: A grid of distinct moods (Happy, Sad, Stressed, Motivated, etc.) allowing users to accurately log their current feeling.
​Tailored Quotes: Each mood category contains a curated set of 50 unique quotes designed to be relevant, comforting, or action-oriented based on the selected emotion.
​Daily Motivation Modal: A full-screen quote automatically appears once per day to provide general encouragement and focus.
​Local History: Mood entries and their associated quotes can be saved and viewed in a history log (data is stored securely in the browser's local storage).
​Minimalist UI: Built with a modern, glass-like aesthetic (--glass, --accent) for a visually calming and engaging experience.
​Pure JavaScript: No external frameworks, ensuring fast loading and simple deployment.

Getting Started
